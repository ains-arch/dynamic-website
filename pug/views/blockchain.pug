      | This is a list of the reading I've been doing pertaining to blockchains, cryptocurrencies, 
      | and anything else that could be lumped in to the "web3" umbrella. As with my other reading 
      | lists, this is just a log of what I've read, not necessarily list of recommendations. I also
      | include other non-written forms of media (podcasts, recorded lectures, etc.) in this list.
    p
      | For the most part, this list won't include the reading I do to research entries that go in 
      a(href="http://web3isgoinggreat.com/")
        i Web3 Is Going Just Great
      |, primarily due to volume. I usually include those articles in the links section of the related 
      i W3IGG
      |  entry, if you're looking for a specific source I used or want to learn more.
