      | This is a list of the shortform reading I've been doing lately. As a part of my professional
      | work, I make sure to read at least two articles a week that pertain to diversity, inclusion,
      | and belonging (DI&B), and this page used to be used for that specific purpose. However, it's
      | gradually become a place to record any shortform reading I've done in addition to that goal
      | as well.

    p
      | I care very much about making sure I am consuming a representative and wide range of 
      | topics in this area, and so welcome suggestions and recommendations! If you know of
      | anything I ought to be reading, please 
      a(href="/contact") send it my way
      | .
