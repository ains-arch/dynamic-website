These include observing who spends more time in the office and at home, ensuring there is equity in who is allowed flexibity in their scheduling of when to be in the office, determining how time in the office affects the promotion process, thinking about how workplace monitoring tools are used, and studying how time at the office (or not) affects employee engagement and retention. I thought it was interesting that the article expressed concern about remote management and monitoring software, while also encouraging employers to use data from things like badge swipes to determine when employees were in the office. It seems to me this data could be used negatively, and possibly pressure employees to come in more than they might otherwise.",

These are reverse search warrants, where police specify a location and ask for individuals meeting those criteria (rather than a traditional warrant, which applies to an individual). Law enforcement are also increasingly using reverse warrants based on keyword searches, where they ask for lists of individuals who performed specific searches. Some privacy experts and lawyers have argued these broad warrants are similar to general warrants, which were prohibited by the fourth amendment.",

McKinsey found much of DI&B work is done by women, and they are largely going unrecognized for it. The study also found that women of color are continuing to have a worse experience at work, and \"although the number of White employees who identify as allies to women of color has increased over the past year, the number taking key allyship actions has not.\" The study summarizes, \"The path forward is clear. Companies need to take bold steps to address burnout. They need to recognize and reward the women leaders who are driving progress. And they need to do the deep cultural work required to create a workplace where all women feel valued.\"",

One journalist describes Facebook's comms team as \"willing to lie on record\", and journalists and sources are both hypervigilant of the possibility that Facebook could use its own products to expose leakers. Silverman ends by saying, \"What Facebook has become is the press's assignment editor, its distribution network, its great antagonist, devourer of its ad revenue, and, through corporate secrecy, a massive block to journalism's core mission of democratic accountability.\"",

She describes their history—how they grew out of the almshouses around the beginning of the 20th century, then private homes filled a void left by the welfare system, and gradually nursing homes became more hospital-like (though often still with poor standards of care). The author says that, although many elderly people want to remain in their homes, many are not aware that in-home care is an option made available to them through Medicaid, and those who are face long waiting lists. The author argues that there needs to be more focus on expanding the amount of in-home care available, more funding towards these services, and work around changing cultural attitudes on things like whether an elderly person with dementia can safely live outside of a nursing facility.",

The law outlaws the vast majority of abortions, as it prevents termination of pregnancies where a heartbeat can be detected, a stage that is often reached before a person even knows they're pregnant. Many reports have been describing this as a \"six-week abortion\", though this is somewhat misleading, as it is actually four weeks after conception, and two weeks after a missed menstrual cycle. Even a person who takes a pregnancy test the first day after a period is missed would need to obtain an appointment for an abortion, despite all waiting periods, within two weeks. The law took effect at midnight on September 1, 2021, and the Supreme Court did not take action on emergency requests to block the law. This is the first law banning abortions at such an early stage of pregnancy that has been allowed to take effect, even briefly.",

She discusses how naive interpretations of GitHub statistics, which show increased time working, more code pushed, and faster merges since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, would suggest a positive outlook on productivity, but that these ignore the enormous amount of burnout and dissatisfaction in the tech industry that point to this being very unsustainable.

        "summary": "An article from <i>Quillette</i>, a generally libertarian- and right-leaning publication, offers an interesting and admirable attempt to convince its readers to be wary of COVID-19 misinformation, and to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Berlinski and Deigin describe Bret Weinstein's statements about COVID-19, which they say evolved from \"entertaining theories that might not be <i>right</i> but could do no harm, to theories that cannot be right and are sure to do harm\". They criticize Weinstein's claims that ivermectin is a COVID-19 \"miracle drug\" (which they say is inaccurate but also relatively harmless, as ivermectin has few side effects), as well as his statements that the approved COVID-19 vaccines are so unsafe that people are dying from them en masse (statements they describe as \"deadly\"). The article offers a perspective that is both deeply libertarian, and also often missing from publications further to the right: \"It is Weinstein's right under the First Amendment to say all of this. But let's not confuse a right to say something with something being right to say.\" It also debunks some of the claims that Weinstein has made on his podcast (for example, \"The impression listeners might get from Weinstein's podcast is that children are at no risk from this disease. This is false.\"), and details the actual risks of COVID-19 vaccines and the scale at which side effects such as blood clots have been observed. The article concludes: \"To put things simply: We have proof that ivermectin is terrific for river blindness and head lice. But if you're taking it to prevent COVID-19 because you heard it was '99 percent effective' on a podcast—while forgoing an mRNA vaccine, because you think that's too dangerous—you've been misled, and you're endangering yourself, your family, your community, and your country. No one disputes Bret Weinstein's right to embrace the theory that ivermectin is a miracle drug, or to regale his listeners with vaccine horror stories and conspiracy theories. But the rest of us reserve the right to be appalled by his judgment and ethics.\"",

        "summary": "Children as young as ten years old are working in American fields for large companies, picking cash crops including tobacco and produce. Although working in tobacco fields holds particular dangers with the exposure to nicotine (which is neurotoxic), all farm labor is particularly dangerous to children due to pesticide exposure, high physical demands, usage of dangerous machinery and tools, exposure to extreme weather, and many other reasons. The issue is in part due to poor regulations, but even existing regulations that would prevent child labor are largely unenforced and ineffective.",

He points out how last year, when Uber gave its largely white corporate employees the day off, its more racially diverse workforce of drivers didn't get a paid holiday. He concludes by saying that \"Unless Congress acts to make Juneteenth a federal holiday -- and let me be clear, they should -- largely-white tech companies run the risk of creating yet another two-tiered American holiday that leaves many people of color behind.\" I think he is overly optimistic to think that Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday, as it just has, will be enough to prevent this split.",

Some members of the team have said they were asked to prioritize higher-profile but less serious incidents (such as those involving reality TV stars or influencers). Settlements which prevent victims of crimes from blaming or suing the company, and language in the platform's terms of service, have also allowed Airbnb to skirt lawsuits, and limited courts' ability to establish the extent to which hosts for Airbnb and similar services could hbe held liable for crimes that are committed in their properties.",

While they are less susceptible to serious illness from COVID-19, they are still at risk for the illness. Some parents are beginning to relax the precautions they were taking with their children, allowing large unmasked group get-togethers, whereas others are continuing to be more cautious. Parents are having to navigate discussing COVID safety with parents who are more ambivalent, and also figure out how to balance safety with potentially introducing difficulties into their childrens' friendships. One parent said of their willingness to relax a previously-enforced precaution: \"You don't want to be the first parent and you don't want to be last.\"",

Workism is common in wealthy men, but people across all classes and genders are finding themselves immersed in a culture that centers around work.<br/>I found one portion of this article questionable: \"95 percent of teens said 'having a job or career they enjoy' would be 'extremely or very important' to them as an adult. This ranked higher than any other priority, including 'helping other people who are in need' (81 percent) or getting married (47 percent). Finding meaning at work beats family and kindness as the top ambition of today's young people.\" This seems an odd conclusion to draw, and it seems odd to include it in an article about workism at all. I think most people who do not define themselves around their work still wish to have a job they enjoy, and it also seems odd to infer that a teenager not prioritizing marriage highly means they don't highly value family in general.",

For example, in Louisville, where Breonna Taylor was murdered in March of 2020, the Citizens Commission on Police Accountability couldn't open an investigation or take citizen complaints; it was limited to reviewing alread-closed internal affairs investigations. Even upon such a review, they could not recommend disclipline; only opine on whether the investigation was sufficient and recommend policy or training changes. In Minneapolis, the officer who murdered George Floyd had already been the subject of 22 misconduct complaints from 2003–2015, and the civilian reviewers handled twelve, but Chauvin remained an officer and did not change his conduct in any way that prevented him from killing Floyd. Some locations massively limit the power of such review committees, and some bar them outright. In some places where oversight committees can recommend disciplinary action for officers, the final decision lies with the police chiefs. Police unions, individuals in law enforcement, and politicians have also tried to block laws calling for more oversight, and pressure those in oversight roles.",

He gives a detailed history of mining operations in the area, as well as efforts by Diné environmental groups to resist them, and interference by politicians on the Navajo Nation.

Benally criticizes white saviors—\"Self-appointed allies, ranging in political spectrum from anarchists to Christian missionaries\"—who have attempted to treat the Diné as a charity project, and to maintain control over them.

She's someone who forces us to contend with our values and challenge our continued investment in a system of policing that sees killing a Black girl with a knife as the only reasonable and effective response. The question we need to ask is not whether Reardon had the legal right to kill her, but rather: Didn't Ma'Khia and the other people involved in the altercation deserve to live?\"",

This was published before the heightened harassment by militias and other members of the right-wing, but discusses many of the challenges they've faced with local groups who challenge their right to live and farm in the area.

If howling is important to you, go off on a howling retreat with other howlers; don't do it in coalition spaces. Blend in if there's not a strong reason not to. Truly, you can be your authentic self without indulging your impulses to howl.\" The article ends with a list of five guidelines for PMC activists to follow to maximize the effectiveness of their work, and to help build cross-class alliances."

Positive predictions for 2025 included reforms relating to racial and social justice, quality of life improvements as a result of increased flexible working, and technological growth in spaces including healthcare and education. The point about misinformation really hit home for me: \"Many respondents said their deepest worry is over the seemingly unstoppable manipulation of public perception, emotion and action via online disinformation – lies and hate speech deliberately weaponized in order to propagate destructive biases and fears. They worry about significant damage to social stability and cohesion and the reduced likelihood of rational deliberation and evidence-based policymaking.\" There is a long appendix of each expert's takes, and they are very thought-provoking."
