While they are less susceptible to serious illness from COVID-19, they are still at risk for the illness. Some parents are beginning to relax the precautions they were taking with their children, allowing large unmasked group get-togethers, whereas others are continuing to be more cautious. Parents are having to navigate discussing COVID safety with parents who are more ambivalent, and also figure out how to balance safety with potentially introducing difficulties into their childrens' friendships. One parent said of their willingness to relax a previously-enforced precaution: \"You don’t want to be the first parent and you don’t want to be last.\"",

Workism is common in wealthy men, but people across all classes and genders are finding themselves immersed in a culture that centers around work.<br/>I found one portion of this article questionable: \"95 percent of teens said 'having a job or career they enjoy' would be 'extremely or very important' to them as an adult. This ranked higher than any other priority, including 'helping other people who are in need' (81 percent) or getting married (47 percent). Finding meaning at work beats family and kindness as the top ambition of today's young people.\" This seems an odd conclusion to draw, and it seems odd to include it in an article about workism at all. I think most people who do not define themselves around their work still wish to have a job they enjoy, and it also seems odd to infer that a teenager not prioritizing marriage highly means they don't highly value family in general.",

For example, in Louisville, where Breonna Taylor was murdered in March of 2020, the Citizens Commission on Police Accountability couldn't open an investigation or take citizen complaints; it was limited to reviewing alread-closed internal affairs investigations. Even upon such a review, they could not recommend disclipline; only opine on whether the investigation was sufficient and recommend policy or training changes. In Minneapolis, the officer who murdered George Floyd had already been the subject of 22 misconduct complaints from 2003–2015, and the civilian reviewers handled twelve, but Chauvin remained an officer and did not change his conduct in any way that prevented him from killing Floyd. Some locations massively limit the power of such review committees, and some bar them outright. In some places where oversight committees can recommend disciplinary action for officers, the final decision lies with the police chiefs. Police unions, individuals in law enforcement, and politicians have also tried to block laws calling for more oversight, and pressure those in oversight roles.",

She’s someone who forces us to contend with our values and challenge our continued investment in a system of policing that sees killing a Black girl with a knife as the only reasonable and effective response. The question we need to ask is not whether Reardon had the legal right to kill her, but rather: Didn’t Ma’Khia and the other people involved in the altercation deserve to live?\"",

This was published before the heightened harassment by militias and other members of the right-wing, but discusses many of the challenges they've faced with local groups who challenge their right to live and farm in the area.

If howling is important to you, go off on a howling retreat with other howlers; don't do it in coalition spaces. Blend in if there's not a strong reason not to. Truly, you can be your authentic self without indulging your impulses to howl.\" The article ends with a list of five guidelines for PMC activists to follow to maximize the effectiveness of their work, and to help build cross-class alliances."

Positive predictions for 2025 included reforms relating to racial and social justice, quality of life improvements as a result of increased flexible working, and technological growth in spaces including healthcare and education. The point about misinformation really hit home for me: \"Many respondents said their deepest worry is over the seemingly unstoppable manipulation of public perception, emotion and action via online disinformation – lies and hate speech deliberately weaponized in order to propagate destructive biases and fears.
